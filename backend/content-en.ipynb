    "We have a database of 1885 respondents. For each, 12 attributes and their score is known. These attributes, which we'll call **features**, are based on the NEO-FFI-R personality test. This test measures the following 5 personality traits:\n",
    "- Neuroticism\n",
    "- Extraversion\n",
    "- Openness to experience\n",
    "- Agreeableness\n",
    "- Conscientiousness\n",
    "\n",
    "We also have access to the Impulsiveness and the Sensation Seeking scores of each respondent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each personality trait has a decimal value as a score. The higher the score, the more the respondent has the corresponding personality trait. For example, a score of 0.8 for the Neuroticism trait means that the respondent is very neurotic.\n",
    "\n",
    "additionally to these 7 personality attributes, we also have access to level of education, age, gender, country of residence and ethnicity of each respondent.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Note that in certain countries, ethnicity statistics are illegal._\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, participants were questioned about their use of 18 legal and illegal drugs: alcohol, amphetamines, amyl nitrite, benzodiazepine, cannabis, chocolate, cocaine, caffeine, crack, ecstasy, heroin, ketamine, legal highs, LSD, methadone, mushrooms, nicotine and volatile substance abuse and one fictitious drug (Semeron) which was introduced to identify over-claimers.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each drug they had to select one of the answers: never used the drug, used it over a decade ago, or in the last decade, year, month, week, or day.\n",

    "- We only give some observations and suppositions about the data and the results. We do not make any definitive statements.\n",
    "- Some features are not well balanced. For example most of the respondents are from the UK. This can lead to biased results.\n",
