# Personality Traits and Drug Consumption: A Data Analysis

_Project currently under development_

### TLDR; this Django Ninja / React App is a simple interactive case study on the relationship between drug consumption and personality traits.


### Introduction

The relationship between personality traits and drug consumption has long been a subject of interest in psychological and sociological studies. This project aims to explore this relationship by analyzing [a dataset of 1,885 respondents'](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mexwell/drug-consumption-classification/data) drug consumption habits and personality traits.

Using data from the _NEO-FFI-R_ personality test and additional information such as **age**, **ethnicity**, **gender**, **education level**, and **country of residence**, we investigate which personality traits are most correlated with the consumption of various legal and illegal drugs. The ultimate goal is to predict which characteristics of an individual make them more likely to consume drugs frequently, which can be valuable for drug prevention programs and policy-making.

In this repository, you will find:

**- Data Analysis**: Exploring the distribution of drug consumption among different age groups, genders, and other non-personality related features.

**- Correlation Analysis**: Using a correlation matrix to identify the strongest correlations between personality traits and drug consumption.

**- Results and Insights**: Observations and findings from the analysis, highlighting key features that influence drug consumption patterns.
