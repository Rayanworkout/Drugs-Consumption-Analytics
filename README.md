# Drug Consumption and Personality, a case study

_Project currently under development_

### This Django Ninja / React App is a simple interactive case study on the relationship between drug consumption and personality traits.

Using [the following dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mexwell/drug-consumption-classification/data), we made some analysis on the relationship between drug consumption and the features available in the dataset.

You can follow it along to see the results and the conclusions we reached.

Project is made by [Sharnalk](https://github.com/Sharnalk), [L7Rayan](https://github.com/l7rayan) and me.

If you're interested about the data processing and the analysis, you can check the notebooks at [`backend/notebooks`](/backend/notebooks/README.md). Each one is documented and commented, as well as all the endpoints necessary to this project.

Features:
 - Django Ninja API
 - React Frontend
 - Data Plotting
 - CI/CD with GitHub Actions and self made deployment server
